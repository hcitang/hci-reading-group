# iSchool HCI/UX Reading Group

The iSchool HCI/UX reading group is an informal reading group that meets once a week to explore HCI/UX research ideas. The primary mission is to sensitize students to topics, methods, and communication that are of central importance to HCI/UX research in the academic world.

We welcome faculty members, post-docs, PhD students, MI students, BI students and anyone else interested in HCI/UX issues. Most importantly, we welcome first-time attendees at every meeting.

## Meetings
* Tuesdays, 4:00pm-5:00pm, online!

## What you should expect
* A 10-15 minutes mini-presentation about the paper being discussed that week by someone leading the discussion.
* A free-wheeling discussion about the the paper (in breakout rooms). This may include questions or critiques about the research questions or methods in the paper, questions/critiques about the paper itself (i.e. its presentation), or even speculation/critical reflection about the consequences of the findings from the papers.
* A nomination of a paper and lead discussant for subsequent weeks.
* On occasion, we may use this as a venue to practice a research talk.

## PhD students!
* Use this as a venue to read/interpret papers that are confusing or you want another set of eyes on
* Use this as an opportunity to brainstorm ideas with others
* Use this as an opportunity to practice research presentations

## Questions?
* Please contact [Zhao Zhao](mailto:zhao.zhao@utoronto.ca) or [Tony Tang](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/profile/tony-tang/)
